### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

welcome to my github profile!
My name is Ivo Serra and I live in Berlin in Germany. I graduated from Digital career Institute in fullstack web development July 2022.
In my channel you will find different repositories such as solo projects, team projects and on-going workshops I keep doing and learning.
Most of my individual and team projects have been deployed and published.
